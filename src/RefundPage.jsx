          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">No Refund Policy</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Due to the digital nature of our Fortnite Zen Script product, <strong>all sales are final and non-refundable</strong>. 
            Once you complete your purchase and receive access to the script files, downloads, and license information, we 
            cannot offer refunds, exchanges, or credits.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why No Refunds?</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Digital products like our Fortnite Zen Script are delivered instantly upon purchase. Unlike physical goods, digital 
            files cannot be "returned" once accessed. To protect our intellectual property and prevent abuse, we maintain 
            a strict no-refund policy on all purchases.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This policy is clearly stated during the checkout process, and by completing your purchase, you acknowledge and 
            accept these terms.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Before You Purchase</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Initiating a chargeback or dispute after receiving your Fortnite Zen Script files is considered fraudulent and may 
            result in:

            <li>Immediate revocation of your license and access to the script</li>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In rare cases, we may consider exceptions to this policy at our sole discretion, such as:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
            <li>Duplicate purchases made by mistake (within 24 hours)</li>

          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
